            <img src="images/bacon.jpg" width = "400" alt="Brown labradoodle wearing colorful lei">

            <p>Bacon Q. Dog is a 9yr old labradoodle. He prefers to spend his days lounging among the three different beds/couches that his family has gifted him. He enjoys a walk or two around the neighborhood, as long as he can pretend that he doesn't see any of the other animals to avoid the embarrassment of not wanting to admit he has no wolf-like skills in chasing them.</p> 
            <P>At night just as the rest of the family is ready to relax, Bacon suddenly wants to release all of his energy. He will place his toys on a mini couch and frantically drag the couch around, giving his toys "a ride." There is also a lot of rolling. Lots and lots of rolling.</P>

            <h2>2. Pluto</h2>
            <img src="images/pluto.jpg" width = "400" alt="White dog looking up">

            <p>Pluto is a five year old rescue dog of an unknown breed. He was found wandering alone and taken to the Valley 
                Humane Society where he found his new family. From a young age, Pluto always had a special personality, he was known 
                for being very very lazy! He spends most of his time staring out the window to keep watch of his house. Do not let 
                the laziness fool you because Pluto defends his family from the mailman and squirrels every single day.
            </p> 
            <P>Aside from his job as defender of the house, Pluto likes to have fun. Pluto’s favorite part of the day is his 
                daily walk. Sometimes he even gets to go to the park and meet his neighbors. He also loves his toy duck, and 
                only his toy duck. As a dog, it's in his nature to hunt and so he makes sure to get some practice with his toy duck.
            </P>

            <p>Loves chasings tennis balls, chipmunks, squirrels, and birds. Often found sitting by the fire in wintertime, and in 
                sun patches when available. He’s energetic, mischievous, and easily bored. He loves people and gets grumpy if left 
                without a lap too long.
            </p> 
            <P>Loves barking up trees, running around on the lawn, and digging in the dirt looking for moles. He 
                especially likes getting treats and whines when he comes inside and doesn’t get a snack.

                and the two are often featured together across social media 
                platforms.

     <h2>5. Sage</h2>
     <img src="images/sage_classic.jpeg" width = "400" alt="A smiling golden retriever lying on the bed">

     <p>Sage is a 3 year old Golden Retriever. She is one of the laziest dogs. 
        She loves sneaking into the bedroom and hopping onto the neatest bed. 
        She also loves riding in a car with the windows open feeling the wind 
        and air. She enjoys walking, only if you take her for a ride to a big 
        arboretum or park. Walking around the neighborhood is not necessarily 
        her cup of tea. 

     </p> 
     <P>Her favorite food is corn. One day, she stole corn on the cob from the 
        dining table, which was surprising because she is normally gentle and 
        polite. She took the stolen corn to the patio and enjoyed her meal by 
        herself. Unfortunately, the corn turned out to be unripe, so she ended 
        up vomiting it all later. 
     </P>
